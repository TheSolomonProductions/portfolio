Sniper Wolf
---
Hello guys, I present to you my artistic vision of Sniper Wolf from Metal Gear Solid. The entire process took 3 months. I undertook this project to study how to implement a playable character in Unreal Engine; it was a lengthy learning process. I didn't have complete experience with the entire process yet, but I managed to successfully complete it.
